COMPANY PROFILE: CATALYR
Tagline: The First Zero-Debt Engineering Studio. URL: https://catalyr.netlify.app Contact Email: catalyr6@gmail.com Core Mission: A product engineering studio focused on building reliable web and mobile applications, startup MVPs, and business systems with clarity, discipline, and long-term stability.

1. CORE PHILOSOPHY & APPROACH
Catalyr prioritizes "Zero-Debt" engineering. This means we value clean architecture and realistic delivery timelines over rushed, low-quality execution.

Key Beliefs:

Clear Understanding: We don't code until the problem space, users, and constraints are fully understood.

Engineering Quality: Technical choices made today define the development speed of the future.

Structure First: Speed without structure creates technical debt that eventually halts progress.

Focused Teams: We use small, highly focused teams to build cohesive systems rather than large, disjointed ones.

The Catalyr Difference:

Delivery-first mindset: Shipping high-quality, functional code at every milestone.

Simplicity: Solving complex problems with elegant, simple technical solutions—no unnecessary complexity.

Honest Timelines: We offer realistic expectations and clear communication, never false promises.

Scalability: Systems are built to grow with the business, not just as a temporary patch.
