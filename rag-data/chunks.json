URL: https://catalyr.netlify.app Contact Email: catalyr6@gmail.com Core Mission: A product engineering studio focused on building reliable web and mobile applications, startup MVPs, and business systems with clarity, discipline, and long-term stability.\n\n1. CORE PHILOSOPHY & APPROACH\nCatalyr prioritizes \"Zero-Debt\" engineering. This means we value clean architecture and realistic delivery timelines over rushed, low-quality execution.\n\nKey Beliefs:\n\nClear Understanding: We don't code until the problem space, users, and constraints are fully understood.\n\nEngineering Quality: Technical choices made today define the development speed of the future.\n\nStructure First: Speed without structure creates technical debt that eventually halts progress.\n\nFocused Teams: We use small, highly focused teams to build cohesive systems rather than large, disjointed ones.\n\nThe Catalyr Difference:\n\nDelivery-first mindset: Shipping",
